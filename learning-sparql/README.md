Some documents from workshops/discussion groups:

[Vanderbilt Heard Library Digital Scholarship Workshop Series on SPARQL - 2015-10-23](sparql-workshop-digital-scholarship.md)

[Learning SPARQL Chapter 3 - part 1 - 2015-10-26](learning-sparql-ch3-part1-answers.md) (includes answers).  See also the PowerPoint that's uploaded in this directory; view online at [https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1572624](https://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1572624).

Note: we skipped around and didn't work through all of the examples. So some examples in part 2 are similar to examples here.
