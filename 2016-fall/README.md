[Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV)](http://lov.okfn.org/dataset/lov/) repository of information on vocabularies used in Linked Data

[A list of Linked Data datasets and vocabularies compiled by the W3C](http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/XGR-lld-vocabdataset/) This is super-good and important.  All of the most authoritative sources relevant to libraries (and pretty much everybody!) are listed here.

<a name="wsession"></a>Sep 26 meeting: Work session

Implementation notes:

1. **Display of Chinese characters in BaseX output.**  I was confused because on my home computer, Chinese characters displayed correctly in the BaseX output screen, while on my work computer they did not display correctly.  After some investigation, I discovered that they must have inherited different default fonts from some system setting or something, since I'd never messed with the font.  I fixed the problem by going to the BaseX Options menu, then selecting Font... .  I then chose SanSerif, Monospaced, Standard, 13 (the defaults on my home computer).  Despite the choice of SanSerif, the output font was serifed (looks like Courier?).  In any case, the Chinese characters then displayed correctly.

2. **Preventing OpenOffice Calc from messing with strings** If you have downloaded OpenOffice to use for editing the CSV files (recommended over using Excel), the default settings include some AutoCorrect options that mess with the characters in the file, for example replacing regular double quotes with "smart quotes".  I recommend turning all AutoCorrect options off.  Go to the Tools menu and select AutoCorrect Options... .  Under the Options and Localized Options tab, uncheck every box, then click OK.  

3. **Setting the local directory in the script** In order to be able to see the effects of modifications to the metadata on the output data, the Xquery script needs to know where to find the CSV files are that you downloaded from GitHub.  There are two ways to take care of this.  One is to figure out what the path is to your fork of the Semantic Web GitHub repo.  Another option is to copy the tang-song folder containing the files from the GitHub repo to some place for which you know the path (e.g. your home directory on a Mac, or some subdirectory of the C: drive on a PC).  In either case, after figuring out the path of the 2016-fall/tang-song/ directory, using BaseX open the serialize.xqm file in the 2016-fall/tang-song/ directory, find line 10, and change the value in quotes of $localFilesFolderUnix to the path of the tang-song directory.  If you are having problems with this, fixing it will be one of the first things that we will do at the meeting on Monday.

Oct. 4 meeting: Continuing with subsections of section 2.3, with specific reference to Tracy's Chinese buildings data.  Be sure to check out [the list of Linked Data datasets and vocabularies compiled by the W3C](http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/lld/XGR-lld-vocabdataset/), which lists many of the most authoritative vocabularies.  We will talk about ontologies and SKOS.  [PowerPoint presentation](linked-data-ch2-3.pdf)

Implementation notes:

1. There are numerous changes to both the data files and the Xquery scripts.  So you should update your local fork of the repo.

2. It is no longer necessary to hard-code anything in the serialze.xqm file or use a different version of the file for Macs and PCs.  Load test-serialize.xq into BaseX, then set the five arguments of the serialize:main() function to appropriate values.  Mac users should be able to start with the defaults.  PC users will have to put the path to the top-level folder of their GitHub fork in the fourth argument.  Changing the last argument from "single" to "dump" will cause the script to generate RDF for the entire database.  Other implementation-specific settings can be made by changing values in the constants.csv file (e.g. the base IRI to be used).

3. There are now two separate CSV metadata tables: one for the temple sites and the other for buildings at those sites.  More about this at the meeting.  

4. There are directions on how to set up all of the files necessary to generate RDF from any CSV files [here](tang-song/readme.md).  It may be easiest to hack the existing tang-song CSV files so that you get the column headers right.

5. I uploaded RDF/XML, RDF/Turtle, and JSON-LD sample files in a [sample](tang/song/samples) directory.  You can try calling the raw versions of the files from RawGit using Postman to see how it gives the correct Content-Type header, e.g. try https://rawgit.com/HeardLibrary/semantic-web/master/2016-fall/tang-song/samples/Longxingsi.ttl .

Oct. 10 meeting: Finishing Chapter 2 and discussing anything that people wanted to review from before.  

I found a good paper that describes why SKOS was designed the way it was.  It is Baker et al. 2013. http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.websem.2013.05.001 .  I was able to access it through ScienceDirect via the Vanderbilt Library.  There are many technical details in the paper, but I would recommend skimming section 3 (Rationale for SKOS) and reading 4.1 (SKOS concepts and how they differ from OWL classes).  Section 4.1 is important for understanding the implications of modeling something as a class, and instance, or a concept.  All of the Getty Vocabularies model entities as SKOS concepts and this section can help us understand why.

I also highly recommend reading [this blog post](http://efoundations.typepad.com/efoundations/2011/09/things-their-conceptualisations-skos-foaffocus-modelling-choices.html) which provides a excellent narrative account of the development of FOAF and SKOS, with examples from VIAF and elsewhere that might provide us with some examples to follow in our modeling.  Here's [one more short post](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Community:Using_SKOS_Concept) on "Using SKOS Concept" that deals with the question "When should something be an instance of SKOS Concept?"

Some tools:

[RDF Translator](http://rdf-translator.appspot.com/) Note: this only seems to work correctly with JSON-LD that is in "expanded" form, not "compacted" form. Convert to expanded form at JSON-LD Playground before converting to other serializations.

[JSON-LD Playground](http://json-ld.org/playground/) Validates JSON-LD and converts from one form to another.  Also includes some examples.

[LODLive for graph visualization](http://en.lodlive.it/)

[W3C RDF validator; generates a graphical display, but only accepts RDF/XML as an input (convert using RDF Translator, then paste in)](https://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/)

[RawGit to serve GitHub RAW files with correct Content-Type headers](http://rawgit.com/)

Things to investigate:

[International Image Interoperability Framework] (http://iiif.io/)

[Mirador] (http://projectmirador.org)
