# Chapter 5 - SPARQL

## Play with this, you StarDogs !!!

Load this stuff into StarDog for SPARQL practice on Monday.

Note: 2016-02-11 (AM): for whatever reason, StarDog doesn't like any of the .rdf files.  I've validated them two places and tried uploading them as Turtle as well, but there is some offending triple(s) somewhere that I'll need to fix.  Stay tuned!

* Andersion orcid, doi, viaf [anderson.rdf](data/anderson.rdf)
* Baskauf orcid, doi, viaf [baskauf.rdf](data/baskauf.rdf)
* Stringer-Hye orcid, doi [stringer-hye.rdf](data/stringer-hye.rdf)
* Warga orcid, doi [warga.rdf](data/warga.rdf)
* Assertions that should have been made by someone [assertions.ttl](data/assertions.ttl)

[Email Steve](mailto:steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu) your ORCID ID and he'll add your data, too.

## Some notes from last semester's SPARQL group are [here](../learning-sparql/README.md).
