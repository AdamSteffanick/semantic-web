#Semantic Web for the Working Ontologist chapter 1 notes

We talked some about the distinction between Linked Data and the Semantic Web.  There is a [blog post called "JSON-LD and Why I Hate the Semantic Web"](http://manu.sporny.org/2014/json-ld-origins-2/), which should be required reading for anybody who is interested in the distinction between the two.  (Google it and look at the cached version if the actual blog isn't coming up.)

Schema.org came up several times at the meeting.  The home page is at [http://schema.org/](http://schema.org/).  Note that schema.org isn't committed solely to RDF in the form of RDFa.  It also supports Microdata and JSON-LD, which support the Linked Data effort without necessarily a committment to the Semantic Web.  An example page showing properties of books and the expected classes of the values is at [http://schema.org/Book](http://schema.org/Book).
