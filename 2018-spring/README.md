## PROV-O: The PROV Ontology https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/ (A W3C Recommendation)

"This ontology specification provides the foundation to implement provenance applications in different domains that can represent, exchange, and integrate provenance information generated in different systems and under different contexts. Together with the PROV Access and Query [PROV-AQ] and PROV Data Model [PROV-DM], this document forms a framework for provenance information interchange in domain-specific Web-based applications.

PROV-O is a lightweight ontology that can be adopted in a wide range of applications. ... The PROV Ontology classes and properties are defined such that they can not only be used directly to represent provenance information, but also can be specialized for modeling application-specific provenance details in a variety of domains."

## PAV ontology: Provenance, authoring and versioning (PAV) https://jbiomedsem.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2041-1480-4-37 (published, but NOT a W3C Recommendation.  Lighter weight and therefore broader than PROV-O)

"Provenance is a critical ingredient for establishing trust of published scientific content. This is true whether we are considering a data set, a computational workflow, a peer-reviewed publication or a simple scientific claim with supportive evidence. Existing vocabularies such as Dublin Core Terms (DC Terms) and the W3C Provenance Ontology (PROV-O) are domain-independent and general-purpose and they allow and encourage for extensions to cover more specific needs. In particular, to track authoring and versioning information of web resources, PROV-O provides a basic methodology but not any specific classes and properties for identifying or distinguishing between the various roles assumed by agents manipulating digital artifacts, such as author, contributor and curator."

Note:
* In Results: PROV-O and PAV mapping shows how PAV refines PROV-O
* In Discussion: comparison to Dublin Core Terms and BIBFRAME.  Also, reference to complexity of FRBR.

## Web Annotation Data Model (a.k.a. Open Annotation or OA) https://www.w3.org/TR/annotation-model/ (W3C Recommendation)

"The Web Annotation Data Model specification describes a structured model and format to enable annotations to be shared and reused across different hardware and software platforms. Common use cases can be modeled in a manner that is simple and convenient, while at the same time enabling more complex requirements, including linking arbitrary content to a particular data point or to segments of timed multimedia resources."

"The Web Annotation Data Model is defined using the following basic principles:

An Annotation is a rooted, directed graph that represents a relationship between resources.
There are two primary types of resource that participate in this relationship, Bodies and Targets.
* Annotations have 0 or more Bodies.
* Annotations have 1 or more Targets.
* The content of the Body resources is related to, and typically "about", the content of the Target resources.
Annotations, Bodies and Targets may have their own properties and relationships, typically including creation and descriptive information.
* The intent behind the creation of an Annotation or the inclusion of a particular Body or Target is an important property and represented by a Motivation resource.""

Note: Described specifically as JSON-LD.
